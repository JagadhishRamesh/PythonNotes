Python Constants
A constant is a special type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned in a module (a new file containing variables, functions, etc which is imported to the main file).

Create a constant.py:

# declare constants 
PI = 3.14
GRAVITY = 9.8

# import constant file we created above
import constant

print(constant.PI) # prints 3.14
print(constant.GRAVITY) # prints 9.8

In reality, we don't use constants in Python. Naming them in all capital letters is a convention to separate them from variables, however, it does not actually prevent reassignment.

Python Literals
Literals are representations of fixed values in a program. They can be numbers, characters, or strings, etc. For example, 'Hello, World!', 12, 23.0, 'C', etc.

Python Numeric Literals
Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types: Integer, Float, and Complex.

Type	Example	Remarks
Decimal	5, 10, -68	Regular numbers.
Binary	0b101, 0b11	Start with 0b.
Octal	0o13	Start with 0o.
Hexadecimal	0x13	Start with 0x.
Floating-point Literal	10.5, 3.14	Containing floating decimal points.
Complex Literal	6 + 9j	Numerals in the form a + bj, where a is real and b is imaginary part

Python Boolean Literals
There are two boolean literals: True and False.

String and Character Literals in Python
Character literals are unicode characters enclosed in a quote. 

Special Literal in Python
Python contains one special literal None. We use it to specify a null variable.

Literal Collections
There are four different literal collections List literals, Tuple literals, Dict literals, and Set literals.

# list literal
fruits = ["apple", "mango", "orange"] 
print(fruits)

# tuple literal
numbers = (1, 2, 3) 
print(numbers)

# dictionary literal
alphabets = {'a':'apple', 'b':'ball', 'c':'cat'} 
print(alphabets)

# set literal
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i' , 'o', 'u'} 
print(vowels)
