Python Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code:
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

#print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, World!")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multi Line Comments
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
