Python Keywords and Identifiers

Python Keywords
Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Python programming that have special meanings to the compiler.

We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

All the keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as they are.

There are 33 keywords in Python
